The get_next_line function should read a single line from a file and return it as a string.
It should also handle multiple file descriptors, end-of-file, and errors gracefully. 
Additionally, it should handle large files that may not fit in memory.

This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection,
but it will also make you learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming: static
variables.
